### Case 51: The brain autopsy showed marked neuronal loss associated with astrogliosis and microglial proliferation of anterior, dorsomedial and posterior thalamic nuclei and two lower olives. Only moderate superficial spongiosis was observed at the frontal, temporal, parietal and insular levels. These would be compatible with the morphological changes described in FFI. The genetic study showed a D178N (aspartic acid to arginine) mutation in PRNP in combination with a polymorphism methionine at codon 129 on the mutated allele. The genotype D178N-129 M is typically seen in FFI. Two years later, our patient’s brother started uncontrollable pruritus as the first symptom of the disease. Maternal relatives were later found to be affected. Due to family history and genetic testing, the case was finally diagnosed not as sporadic but as FFI and genetic counseling was offered to the rest of the family
